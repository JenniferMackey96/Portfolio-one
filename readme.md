# Responsive Views

Below is a sample of the Castletroy Yoga & Mindfullness Websites Responsive view on different devices:


# User Experience Design
# Design

The design is clean, modern and easy to navigate - I have choosen a colour pallet of cool warm browns and orange in order to invoke a calm atmosphere.

The homepage (index.html) contains a large hero image at the top of the page, along with the title of the website. The text overlay on desktop is larger than the infomation text in order to create a distinctive contrast and moves on smaller screen sizes for compatibility.

# Typography
The Lato font is the main font used throughout the whole portfolio website. Sans Serif is the fallback in case the main font isn’t being imported to the site correctly.

# Imagery
All images are taken from the Pexels Website. All the pictures are pictures related to yoga and mindfullness in order to create a calming effect. I tried to match the colors on the website with the colors used in the selected images.

# Features

I aimed to provide a clear, easy to understand and easy to navigate website that would appeal to customers interested in yoga and mindfullness.

# Navigation

The home page allows you to change between pages, contact us, gallery and home.
It is positioned to be easy to view, and styled to be easy to read, with underlining at selection stage.
On the form page, once the calculate button is pressed, a modal opens with your range results.

Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Gallery, and Contact page and is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation.
This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

# Browser Compatibility
I tested the appearance and responsiveness of 4 browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Edge) and it showed good results in all browsers.

# Test the Footer
I selected the different social media icons on different devices and browsers also in order to check that they open in a different tab.

# Contact Page
When testing a page, the Name and Description fields allow input of any text while Email requires the input of Email form. I repeated the test several times and each time it was successful.

# Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

# Credits
Most of the code was developed by the use of Bootstrap's library and w3schools throughout the project to ensure the responsiveness of the website such as the Navbar, The Main Image, and Gallery. I also found some inspiration in two Code Institute projects: Love Running and with the help of slack and other students to help answer some issues I had throughout.

# Media
All the pictures are downloaded from pexels.com
colour codes are from rapidtables.com

I would like to say a quick thank you to:

The slack community for its extensive Q&A, I found most of the answers to my problems there.
Thanks to everyone at the Code Institute for helping to make this such an enjoyable and rewarding experience although I found it difficult at times, i am proud of the website i created and the fact i got this opportunity to use the skills i gained throughout the first secetion of this course.
I am extremely happy to be able to put my skills into practice now and be able to create a website for my family business which was one of my smaller goals for starting this course. I am really greatful to be given this opportunity thus far.
